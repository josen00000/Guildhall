Deep Learning:
While finishing the app.cpp file, I tried to figure out how to make the file look elegant with all the classes and
variables in the right place. However, I failed. I did not know the relationships between the variables and classes. 
Finally, I just initialize them at the beginning of the app.cpp and it is kinds of a mess. However, I created my initializing function
to create the vertex, camera, and other objects and variables and tried to create the variables at the correct time. I need to learn
how to organize my code well. Currently, I still have little ideas about the rules about how to program. For example, when and where is the best to initialize the variable? What are the best types of
parameters we need to pass to the functions? I know some about the principle of programming rules, but I hope to learn
how to achieve it in my codes. I understand that using const can mark the parameters only readable and prevent 
the parameters accessed from the function(when I find it in the given code).
