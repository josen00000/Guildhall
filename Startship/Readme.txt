Deep Learning:
When I working on assignment 3, I was considerating the maintenance of the code. When updating the Game.cpp code to meet
the requirement of assignment 3, I found it is hard to do it. After finishing assignment2 and adding code of assignment 3, 
there are many conflicts between the codes. In order to add the new functionalities of the game, I have to modify the original
code to suit the new codes. I think it is better for me in the future to manage my code at the beginning of coding so that it 
will not cause many conflicts when I keep adding new codes. I want to learn a basic framework of coding so that I can get good
code management when doing projects. I still want to know the flow of the engine better. I don't know the renderer functions and 
the camera functions clearly. Currently, I just implement the functions without considering the correct position and correct function
name. The camera shake is recommended to be implemented in BeginCamera in Renderer. But my BeginCamera is an empty function.
I need to learn more about rendering and camera functions.
